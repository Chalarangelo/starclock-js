# Javascript/jQuery Astronomical Clock #

A simple "astronomical" looking clock that I designed in my free time. The planets represent units of time (seconds, minutes, hours, weekdays etc.) and their rotation is calculated accordingly based on the current time.

## Live version ##

There is a live version of the project, available [here](http://chalarangelo.github.io/starclock-js/index.html).

## Dependencies ##

The project is heavily based on jQuery functionality. 

## Usage ##

Like I said above, this project was designed in my spare time and does not server any practical purpose except looking kinda pretty. Feel free to tinker with the CSS file if you want to embed it in some page or just use it "as is" if you want a page that shows the time in a nice-looking way.

## License ##

The project is licensed under the MIT License, however it would be nice if you could credit me if you fork or use my code.
