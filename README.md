## Setup & Usage

### Dependencies

The project is heavily based on jQuery. Except for that, you are good to go. 

### Customization

Feel free to tinker with the CSS and Javascript files if you feel like the design and/or update times are not what you would like.  If you want to add/remove planets, just change the according `div`s in the HTML file. To remove the footer to the project's repository on github, simply remove all the content between inside `<div id="footer">...</div>`. You can also remove the top clock display and/or the adjust icon, be removing the contnet inside `<div id="sun-text">...</div>`. Remember to update the Javascript methods accordingly if you remove the whole `div`s.
